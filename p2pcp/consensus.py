"""p2pcp_consensus.py — the block-lattice conflict-vote (§9). Build step 6, v0.1 capstone.

Consensus is invoked RARELY and NARROWLY. In a block-lattice there is no global
total order to agree on; the ONLY event needing global agreement is a FORK — two
different records at the same height on ONE account's chain (a provable double-
spend, since both are self-signed by that account). Everything else is local and
asynchronous, balances optimistically final (§5).

This module is the deterministic RULE that resolves a fork, given votes weighted
by **decayed cumulative burn** (§6/§10), resolving at a **supermajority** — never
a knife-edge, because weight is locally fuzzy (§6). It is pure and offline: the
DECISION lives here and is testable alone; the vote GOSSIP (assembling a quorum
across many nodes, and eclipse-resistance) is the daemon's job and the honest
open problem of v0.2 (§9.3, Appendix B).

Two franchise facts fall straight out of the ledger and are enforced here:
  * weight is decayed burn, so a Sybil SPLIT does not multiply votes (§10) — the
    tally weighs weight, not heads;
  * a proven cheat is **slashed**: the fork's author (a double-spender), and a
    worker whose replay-class receipt fails a replay challenge (§7) — both lose
    their franchise.
