"""p2pcp_daemon.py — the node daemon skeleton (host app). Build step 4 (§14).

P2PCP reference implementation. The daemon is the host app that owns the node's
three parts and wires them together (RFC §4 node anatomy):

    Daemon (this file: keys + ledger state + the organ + accept loop)
      → SocketOrgan   (p2pcp_socket — the ONE network limb, §1.5)
      → Ledger        (p2pcp_ledger — the TCM + block-lattice, §5/§8)
      → worker adapters / wire contract   (SEAM — steps 5-6)

**This module does NOT import `socket`.** All network I/O goes through the organ
(§1.5) — the one-organ boundary holds. It is a SKELETON: it can listen, dial,
and complete a signed HELLO handshake that establishes *verified identity over
the wire* (trustless — any stranger may HELLO), and it exposes the seam where the
ledger-settled wire contract (step 5: "the first job that crosses is already a
paid job") plugs in. The paid contract itself is deliberately NOT here yet.

What HELLO proves and does not: it proves the peer controls the private key for
the account it announces (they produced a valid ed25519 signature over their
announcement, via the same `alg` table the ledger uses). Per-session liveness /
anti-replay is established by the wire contract's own signed, nonce'd frames in
step 5 — noted at the seam, not faked here. Trust is never granted by the socket;
identity is a key, and standing is burn-weight, both above this layer.
