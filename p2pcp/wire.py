"""p2pcp_wire.py — the wire contract frames (spec §4 L2, Appendix C).

Contract v1 generalized over the wire: JOB / RESULT / RECEIPT / RECEIPT_ACK /
DONE, as self-describing JSON envelopes carried inside the socket organ's framed
transport. Pure functions — no socket, no ledger state, no clock — so the framing
and the receipt serialization are testable on their own.

The exchange (spec §11 settlement granularity — settle per chunk, so neither
party is exposed for more than one chunk of k units):

  requester → JOB {job cargo + wire MMID, n_chunks, k, vclass}
  worker    → RESULT {chunk i output + its wire MMID}          (per chunk)
  requester → RECEIPT {a receipt for k, requester-signed}      (per chunk)
  worker    → RECEIPT_ACK {the same receipt, now both-signed}  (per chunk)
  worker    → DONE {reason}                                    (at the end)

A Receipt (p2pcp_ledger.Receipt) is carried as a flat dict of hex fields; the
receiving side re-instantiates it into its OWN Receipt class, so the wire crossing
is agnostic to which module instance built it.
