"""p2pcp_ledger.py — the P2PCP block-lattice mutual-credit ledger + TCM.

P2PCP reference implementation. P2PCP is a protocol, not a TernOO component (spec §0); TernOO is the reference implementation. Offline ledger core — no sockets, no wall-clock in logic.

Canon: ``docs/P2PCP-v0.1-SPEC.md`` (v0.1, Stevo + CC, Adelaide). Where a
section is cited below (§5, §8, ...) the spec is the source of truth; this file
is one projection of it. Build order §14 steps 2–3: the adversarial fixtures and
the receipts+burn ledger, offline and single-node.

What lives here (and ONLY this):
  * Two machines kept separate (§2). This file is the **TCM** — the *total*
    contract-machine that validates ledger records in bounded, straight-line
    work. The *worker* (inference, cargo execution) is deliberately absent: an
    inference job is never validated here, only referenced by MMID.
  * The block-lattice (§5): one hash-linked chain per identity, mutual credit,
    double-entry so that minting your own money nets to zero.
  * Weight from decayed burn (§5/§6), Sybil-conserving (§10).
  * TIME defused by parameter, never by a wall-clock read (§6): every function
    that needs "now" takes it as an explicit argument. Tests pass fixed clocks.
  * Privacy (§7): the on-ledger settlement carries a *blinded* job commitment
    ``H(MMID ‖ nonce)`` and the receipt-hash — never the bare job MMID. The full
    Receipt is a separate, off-ledger, both-signed object.
  * The ``alg`` field (§12): a data-driven dispatch table. ``alg=0`` is real
    ed25519 + a gauntlet-grade wire digest; ``alg=1`` is the recognized-but-
    unimplemented ternary-native stub; unknown alg is a graceful reject.

Crypto doctrine (§12.3): signatures are real ed25519 (PyNaCl). Nothing here
home-rolls a signature. The wire digest is SHA3-256. (The TernOO build adds
optional native flavour — a ternary store digest and 24-trit header words — as a
plugin; the standalone core needs none of it.)
